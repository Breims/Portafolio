				As a <span class="font-bold font-Raleway">Frontend Web Developer</span>, my passion lies in creating
				exceptional digital experiences that captivate users. My skills are centered around
				essential languages like <span class="font-bold font-Raleway">JavaScript</span> and <span class="font-bold font-Raleway">TypeScript</span>, and my experience spans a variety of
				cutting-edge technologies such as <span class="font-extrabold">Next.js, React, Astro</span>,
				and <span class="font-extrabold">Svelte</span>. These tools enable me to develop attractive
				and highly functional interfaces.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-6">
				My collaborative approach is evidenced by my ability to seamlessly integrate into
				multidisciplinary teams, where I contribute creative solutions that merge design and
				functionality. My perspective is that of a perpetual learner, always ready to take on new
				challenges and add value to high-quality projects.

				I am excited about the infinite possibilities that the world of web development has to
				offer, and I eagerly look forward to being part of projects that make a difference in the
				digital experience.
